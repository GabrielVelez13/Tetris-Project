## Inspiration for the project
It has been a dream of mine to create my own clone of Tetris, and now it will become a reality.
Special thanks to Coder Space's tutorial which will be used as a baseline and guidance for the project. 

## Goals for the Project
* Get acquainted with Pygame
* Use OOP fundamentals throughout the whole project
* Practice file organization
* Create my very own Tetris clone
